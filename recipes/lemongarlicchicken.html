    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This one-pan lemon garlic chicken and asparagus minimizes cleanup, with chicken and asparagus cooked in the same skillet. The lemony, garlicky, buttery sauce adds loads of flavor to the chicken and the asparagus. Complete your meal with a crusty bread and a salad, if you like.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 skinless, boneless chicken thighs (about 2 pounds)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, or any herb blend</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 pound asparagus,  ends trimmed, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic, or to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 lemon, juiced</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons cold unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley</li>
            <li>1 lemon, sliced (optional)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly coat a Bundt pan with cooking spray.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Add potatoes, red pepper, green pepper, onion, carrot, olive oil, salt, pepper, and 1 teaspoon Greek seasoning to a large bowl and toss well to coat. Add mixture to the bottom of the prepared Bundt pan.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Sprinkle chicken evenly with remaining Greek seasoning. Place chicken cavity over the Bundt pan center with legs facing down on top of the vegetables. Place Bundt pan on a rimmed baking sheet. </li>
            <br>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 1 hour 10 minutes. Cover the top half with foil after 30 minutes to avoid over-browning. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li> 
            <br>
            <li>Remove chicken to a serving platter or cutting board to rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Toss veggies with feta and dill, and serve with sliced chicken. Top with more lemon zest. </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
