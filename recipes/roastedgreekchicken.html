            <li>1 green bell pepper, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces </li> 
            <li>1 large red onion, cut into 1-inch pieces </li> 
            <li>2 large carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces </li> 
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil </li> 
            <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt </li> 
            <li>1 tablespoon Greek seasoning, divided </li> 
            <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper </li> 
            <li>2 teaspoons lemon zest, plus more for garnish </li> 
            <li>1 (3 to 4 pound) whole chicken, cleaned and patted dry with paper towels </li> 
            <li>1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese </li>

        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly coat a Bundt pan with cooking spray.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add potatoes, red pepper, green pepper, onion, carrot, olive oil, salt, pepper, and 1 teaspoon Greek seasoning to a large bowl and toss well to coat. Add mixture to the bottom of the prepared Bundt pan.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Sprinkle chicken evenly with remaining Greek seasoning. Place chicken cavity over the Bundt pan center with legs facing down on top of the vegetables. Place Bundt pan on a rimmed baking sheet. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 1 hour 10 minutes. Cover the top half with foil after 30 minutes to avoid over-browning. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). </li>
        <br>
        <li>Remove chicken to a serving platter or cutting board to rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Toss veggies with feta and dill, and serve with sliced chicken. Top with more lemon zest.  </li>
        </ol>
